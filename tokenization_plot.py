text = "The ancient city of Babylon, located in present-day Iraq, was one of the most influential centers of Mesopotamian civilization. Known for its impressive architectural achievements, the city was home to the famous Hanging Gardens, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Babylon was also significant for the development of early laws, as evidenced by the Code of Hammurabi, one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world. The cityâ€™s rich cultural and scientific advancements influenced many aspects of later civilizations, including mathematics, astronomy, and literature."
